### Hey! ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Antonio DiCerbo. I'm a software developer who's recently graduated a software engineering bootcamp. I am passionate about what I'm doing and currently trying to absorb any and all knowledge I can in order to be as proficient as possible in this field. 

About me:
I have a passion for 90s Japanese and European cars
I'm a washed college football player
I love to tinker with anything mechanical as well as software!
